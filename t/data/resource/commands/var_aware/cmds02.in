# Assume three performance perf_classes and 4 jobs. 
# Best perf_class is perf_class=1, worst perf_class is perf_class=3.
# Job1 has 2N, Job2 has 1N, Job3 has 4N, Job4 is 1N.
# In this test case, perf_class of node2 and node 4 is not set, 
# so the policy will treat these as 9999 (worst efficiency).  
# Variation aware policy will schedule Job1 on N1 and N3, Job2 on N5,
# Job3 on N7,N0,N6 and N2; and Job4 on N4.
